# PowerValidatedSolutions
## Overview
PowerValidatedSolutions is a PowerShell Module that has been written to explicitly support the automation of various procedures associated with the implementation of Validated Solutions for VMware Cloud Foundation. 

The intent is to reduce human error, deliver consistency and robustness as well as expedite the time to deploy for customers by developing cmdlets that remove the complexities associated with performing deployment and configuration steps using Public/Private APIs or command line based tooling.

Using the cmdlets developed, we are providing our customers an infrastructure-as-code deployment model allowing them to develop their own in-house end-to-end automation.

## Installing the module

If you want to use this Microsoft PowerShell module to perform implementation and configuration procedures, you must first install a number of PowerShell module from the PowerShell Gallery. To do this, run the following in your PowerShell console:

```PowerShell

Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -MinimumVersion 7.1.1
Install-Module -Name PowerVCF -MinimumVersion 2.1.7
Install-Module -Name PowerValidatedSolutions -MinimumVersion 1.4.0
```

To verify the modules are installed, run the following command in the PowerShell console.
